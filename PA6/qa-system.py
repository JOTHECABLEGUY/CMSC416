## Question-Answer System program ##
# Implemented by Jordan Dube for PA 6 for CMSC 416 w/ Prof. McInnes
# Credit to Prof. McInnes, the slides, and wikipedia.readthedocs.io/en/latest/code.html#api for providing insights into helpful features and tips #
# Python 3.9.12

# usage: python qa-system.py log_file.txt
#			log_file.txt -> string filename of a file to store information as the program progresses for review after the program terminates

# The problem is that we want to create a system capable of answering any question that a user can ask (as long as it is a "who", "what", "when", or "where" question).
#	Rather than use a pre-trained model, we want dynamic information retrieval through the use of the internet. With this system,
#	users would be able to access information quicker than they could on their own since they would be aided by a CPU's computational power.

## Example run:
##		%python python qa-system.py log_file.txt
##		*** This is a QA system by Jordan Dube.
##		        It will try to answer questions that start with Who, What, When or Where.
##		        Enter 'exit' to leave the program.
##		=?>     Who is George Washington
##		=>      George Washington is a 39-volume set edited by John Clement Fitzpatrick, whom the George Washington Bicentennial Commission commissioned.
##		=?>     Who was George Washington
##		=>      George Washington was an American military officer, statesman, and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.
##		=?>     What is the Moon
##		=>      The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.
##		=?>     What is an apple
##		=>      An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica.
##		=?>     When was Barack Obama born
##		=>      Barack Obama was born on August 4, 1961.
##		=?>     When did Edison die
##		=>      Edison died on October 18, 1931.
##		=?>     When is Christmas
##		=>      Christmas is on December 25.
##		=?>     Where is the Louvre
##		=>      The Louvre is in Paris, France.
##		=?>     Where is Virginia
##		=>      Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains.
##		=?>     exit
##		Thank you! Have a nice day! :)

## Below is an excerpt from the log file for the last search: "Where is Virginia"
##		=?>	Where is Virginia

##		SEARCHED FOR: Virginia is in
##		TITLES OF PAGES RETURNED: ['Virginia', 'West Virginia', 'Virginia is for Lovers', 'Virginia Beach, Virginia', 'VirgÃ­nia', 'Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus', 'Richmond, Virginia', 'List of cities and counties in Virginia', 'Virginia Woolf', 'Arlington County, Virginia']

##		SENTENCE FOUND: Virginia, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains
##		USING PATTERN:re.compile('\\bVirginia\\b.*?\\bis\\b.*?\\bin\\b(.*)\\b,?')
##		ANSWER:  the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains
##		=>	Virginia is in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains.

### Description of qa-system.py:

###		This program starts by creating a QA object using the log file from the command line. It opens the file for writing into as well as compiles
###		some regexes that can be used later. Once this setup is done the program can not be run. The program prompts the user for an input question
###		that is of the who/what/when/where form. The question is then processed. the question mark is removed, 
###		the question is split into words, the verb to be is looked for, and an initial topic of the query is extracted.
###		Then, the program branches depending on what interrogative word was used. If it is a who question, the return type is set to 'person',
###		and if the verb to be was not found, the verb is changed to 'was' and the auxiliary words get assigned the last word in the query
### 	concatenated with 'by'. The program also indicates that the answer may come before the verb through the looking_back flag.
###		If it is a "when" question, the return type is set to date and the second word in the question is checked. If the second word
###		is 'did', then the last word is treated as the verb and it is converted to past tense with the addition of the word 'on'. 
###		If the last word in the query is not capitalized and the second word is 'was', then the last word in the question
###		is treated as the verb and the additional word 'on' is appended. If the last word is capitalized, then only the word 'on'
###		is needed. If it is a what question, no additional words are necessary and the return type is set to object. If it is a 
###		where question then the return type is 'place' and a check is done if the second word in the question is 'did' and if it is,
###		then the last word in the question is treated as the verb. In either case, the additional word 'in' is added to encourage
###		a lean towards location in the event of ambiguity. Once these steps have been taken, the question processing concludes with
###		extraction and storage or articles and a vector with the topic, looking back flag, articles, verbs, return type, and 
###		additional words are returned.

###		Once the question is processed, if there was an invalid format, then a message is sent to the user, otherwise the program
###		moves to getting the answer using the question. The individual components are then unpacked and used for building the query
###		that will be used to create a search query and the patterns to look for in the documents. If the looking back flag is set,
###		then 2 patterns are created, 1 to look for the answer before the topic and the other looks for the answer after the topic. 
###		If the flag isn't set then only 1 pattern is created to look after the topic. The patterns are then compiled, the search
###		is used to retrieve the top 10 ranked documents based on the query from Wikipedia. These 10 titles are then used to retrieve
###		their referenced pages. If any titles are ambiguous, then that term is not used, but the other titles are still checked.
###		There are multiple checks throughout the extraction process that check if an answer has been found, so as soon as an answer 
###		is extracted it can be returned. The contents of the pages are split by '.' into sentences, any sentence that matches a pattern
###		being checked is returned for further extraction. For every search and match event a new entry in the log file is generated.
###		If the initial extraction is unsuccessful, the return type is appended to the search query to further disambiguate the search.
###		If the results have been checked, and no match has been found, them the query is shortened by 1 word and the process repeats 
###		starting from building the search query. If no match is found with any query, then the program will answer that it cannot 
###		answer the question. If the return type is a date, the program conducts a series of tests that result in a standardized date
###		being extracted from the answer. If a match was found for a date return type, but there are no numbers in it, then it will
###		also register as unable to be answered. The answer is then condensed into a complete sentence using the topic, article, auxiliary
###		words, and the verb 'to be' if is was found/assign in question processing. This sentence is returned where it is logged and
###		printed to the user, after which they can ask their next question. This loop repeats until the user types 'exit'.
